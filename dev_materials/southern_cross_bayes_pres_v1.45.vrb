\begin{block}{MCMC parameters in JAGS}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{n.chains}: num. of MCMC chains; more is better
\item \texttt{n.adapt}: discard first samples; let algorithm 'adapt'
\item \texttt{n.burn}: discard extra samples; allow algorithm to reach stationary distribution
\item \texttt{n.iter}: total number of sample; more is better
\item \texttt{thin}: take every \(k^{th}\) iteration for a sample; decorrelates one sample from the next; higher is better
\item total samples: number of samples to approximate your Posterior; target at least 2000 to 5000
\end{itemize}
