# PRACTICAL EXERCISE PART 5: Cormack-Jolly-Seber in JAGS
# as part of the 2017 SMM Workshop "Bayesian Capture-Recapture" by Dr. R.W. Rankin and Mrs. K.E. Nicholson
# There are TWO DEMONSTRATIONS below and TWO EXERCISES
# DEMONSTRATION 1: phi(sex)p(sex) with beta priors
# DEMONSTRATION 2: phi(sex)p(sex) with logit-normal priors
# EXERCISE 1: phi(t,sex)p(t,sex) with beta priors
# EXERCISE 2: phi(t,sex)p(t,sex) with logit-normal priors

# Data from Nicholson et al 2012. Abundance, survival and temporary emigration of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) off Useless Loop in the western gulf of Shark Bay, Western Australia. Mar. Freshwater Res. 63, 1059â€“1068. doi:10.1071/MF12210 . In the original study was for a PCRD system (multiple secondary periods per primary period). For this exercise, everything has been flattened to a single capture period

# CJS Exercise 1

# In this exercise, you will modify the phi(sex)p(sex) model and make it a fuly-time-varying model. I.e., the script belong uses constant phi and constant p (only variation in sex). Try to edit the JAGS code to have time-varying survival (phi) and time-varying capture p.
# *NOTE: remember that: phi[T-1] and p[T] cannot be seperated
# *NOTE: remember that: there is no ``p_1'' conceptually (because the CJS conditions on first capture), BUT in the JAGS syntax we cannot have a vector that skips the first value, i.e., there must be a p[1]. So, just keep in mind that all the JAGS p's are offset by one entry.
# *HINTS: - the transition matrix WAS 3 dimensional [state,state,sex] but will now be 4-dimensional [state,state,sex,time]. Similarly for the emission matrix
# *HINTS: - previously, phi was just a vector with three values (female,male, unknown); but now it should be a MATRIX with rows representing TIME and columns representing SEX. A similar idea applies to p
# *HINTS: - previously, the priors on phi was encoded as a matrix, with rows as SEX and columns as the Beta shape parameters (a and b). Now, the priors of phi should be a 3D ARRAY with rows represent TIME, columns represent SEX and slices representing SHAPE-PARAMETERS. A similar idea applies to p.
# *HINTS: - you must enforce a constraint on the last value of phi's. Enforce phi[T-2]=phi[T-2]. Unfortunately, you CANNOT mix random (~) and deterministic (<-) elements in a single vector in JAGS. In other words, you can't do...
# phi[1] ~ dbeta(a1,b1)
# phi[2] ~ dbeta(a2,b2)
# phi[3] ~ dbeta(a3,b3)
# phi[4] <- phi[3]
# ... the best way is to make two different objects: one for random variables only, and then shunt those values into another "deterministic" object. E.g.,
# phi.rv[1] ~ dbeta(a1,b1)
# phi.rv[2] ~ dbeta(a2,b2)
# phi.rv[3] ~ dbeta(a3,b3)
# phi[1] <- phi.rv[1]
# phi[2] <- phi.rv[2]
# phi[3] <- phi.rv[3]
# phi[4] <- phi.rv[3] # NOTICE THE ENFORCEMENT OF CONSTRAINT HERE

# CJS Exercise 2
# In this exercise, you will modify the sex-varying logit-normal model phi(logit(sex))p(logit(sex)) make it a fuly-time-varying model. You will KEEP the effort:sex decomposition for p: it is already time-varying because of the use of EFFORT covariate (which is the time-varying thing). So, this exercise only involved modification of phi to make it sex and time varying.
# *NOTE: there are TWO WAYS to do a sex and time variation: i) the "main effects" model includes a main effort for time and a main effect of sex (being a male), in which case the sex effect is the same magnitude each year. ii) the "interaction" model has independent sex-effects each year, so the sex effect of being a male in period one is different from the sex effect in period 2. You must decide which you would like to do. The main effects model is more CONSTRAINED and easier to do, the INTERACTION model is likely more realistic but may be overly-complex
# *HINT: previously, the priors for phi were stored in a matrix with rows representing sex and columns representing the Normal parameters MEAN and PRECISION. Your prior structure will be different now that phi will be time-varying. In the main effects model: there is a PRIOR for the intercept (females in year 2), a prior for the main effect of being male, and a prior for the main effect of being 'unsexed/unknown', then there will be a prior for the main effect of year 3, a prior for the year effect of year 4, and a prior for the year effect of year 5. Alternatively, in the interaction model, there will be prior for EVERY COMBINATION: f-year2, f-year3, f-year4, f-year5, m-year2, m-year3, m-year4, m-year5, u-year2, u-year3, u-year4, u-year5.
